1.4.5.2  Fri Sep 21 04:40:01 PDT 2007
    Bug Fixes
    * Last minute change to the last version broke the build.
    
    Portability Fixes
    * Fixed the running of configure so it works on Cygwin.

1.4.5.1  Thu Sep 20 17:41:55 PDT 2007
    Now it really works!  Tried it on a clean Ubuntu machine with no
    SVN libraries installed.
    
    Bug Fixes
    * Now doing a complete SVN build to ensure everything is built properly
    * All the SVN libraries are installed along with the Perl bindings
    
    Portability Fixes
    * Now uses $Config{make} instead of a hard coded make
    * Asks what make to use.

    Installation improvements
    * Asks if the user wants to run Subversion's configure (default yes)
    * Checks if configure has already been run and asks if it has (default no)

1.4.5.0  Wed Sep 12 03:10:01 PDT 2007
    First release.  Turns out it doesn't really work unless libsvn is
    already installed.
